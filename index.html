<hr><p><strong># A mechanism for extracting semantically-aware knowledge in Software Repositories</strong></p>

<p>We humans are confronted with an unprecedented increase in the amount of information we intake, in
virtually every part of our digital life. The field of Software Engineering, being a central foothold of the
modern human activity, has been inevitably affected. As a direct consequence, software products that
meet our needs have grown, evolved, multiplied. Along, software data have grown too, so much that,
following the trend of the time, could not be ignored anymore. Thus, the field of Mining Software
Repositories has emerged...</p>

<p>Related literature up to this point have been studying mainly changes in program source code, leaving
out information residing in other kinds of Software Repositories, which have remained relatively
unexploited.</p>

<p>Current diploma thesis attemps to bridge the gap and exploit data coming from Software Issue Tracking
Systems. Focus is given on extracting knowledge on one of the most critical facets of Software
development, that of identifying bugs. We have developed a mechanism that semantically analyzes
certain features of the available data, in order to detect the latent information inside the natural
description coming with the bug reports. To do so, we have exploited primitives from the fields of
Natural Language Processing, Semantic Analysis and Semantic Relatedness.</p>

<p>The final product of the diploma thesis is a multi-variate mechanism for extracting semantically-aware
knowledge in Software Repositories of well-known and fairly developed projects.</p>
