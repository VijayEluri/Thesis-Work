The field of Software Engineering, being a central foothold of the\r\nmodern human activity, has been inevitably affected. As a direct consequence, software products that\r\nmeet our needs have grown, evolved, multiplied. Along, software data have grown too, so much that,\r\nfollowing the trend of the time, could not be ignored anymore. Thus, the field of Mining Software\r\nRepositories has emerged...\r\n\r\nRelated literature up to this point have been studying mainly changes in program source code, leaving\r\nout information residing in other kinds of Software Repositories, which have remained relatively\r\nunexploited.\r\n\r\nCurrent diploma thesis attemps to bridge the gap and exploit data coming from Software Issue Tracking\r\nSystems. Focus is given on extracting knowledge on one of the most critical facets of Software\r\ndevelopment, that of identifying bugs. We have developed a mechanism that semantically analyzes\r\ncertain features of the available data, in order to detect the latent information inside the natural\r\ndescription coming with the bug reports. To do so, we have exploited primitives from the fields of\r\nNatural Language Processing, Semantic Analysis and Semantic Relatedness.\r\n\r\nThe final product of the diploma thesis is a multi-variate mechanism for extracting semantically-aware\r\nknowledge in Software Repositories of well-known and fairly developed projects.\r\n\r\n\r\nNikolaos Stasinopoulos, November 2010\r\n","name":"Thesis-work","google":"","tagline":"A mechanism for extracting semantically-aware knowledge in Software Repositories"}
